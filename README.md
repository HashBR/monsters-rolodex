Created with the Udemy Course "Complete React Developer in 2022 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)".
The course can be found here: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/

This was the first small project in the course. I changed a bit to show actual people instead of ugly monsters.
